The Queensland Centre for Population Research (QCPR) undertakes pure and applied research and provides education and training in demography and population geography. The work of the centre focuses especially on demographic change at the local and regional level, both within Australia and overseas and encompasses theory, methodology and empirical analysis. Research interests focus particularly on population mobility, internal migration, the development of demographic forecasting models, health geography and population aging.

## A sample of our work:

### An interactive dashboard using R: the example of the Queensland COVID-19 tracker

### Estimating temporary populations - Tracking short-term changes in population distributions

Drawing on new and emerging sources of data, this project will develop a novel series of population estimates for Australian regions and localities that encompasses visitors and other temporary movements, and will complement existing estimates of resident populations. It will clarify user needs, evaluate data quality, apply metrics to capture key forms of temporary mobility, and integrate symptomatic data to estimate the timing and magnitude of population flux at local and regional levels. These results will advance the science of population estimation and have direct practical relevance to planning, while positioning Australia at the forefront in addressing a growing global information need.
